Sai D is a mediocre human (co-median) from Chennai, India. While in graduate school at University of Michigan, he started doing stand up to effectively procrastinate writing his thesis. For two years, he performed every week and occasionally hosted shows at the Ann Arbor Comedy Showcase. He recently moved to Silver Spring, MD, where he has performed on showcases alongside Robert Mac, Paris Sashay and many other local favorites.
