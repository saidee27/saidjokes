# Biography
Sai D is a mediocre human (co-median) from Chennai, India. While in graduate school at Ann Arbor, he started doing stand up to effectively procrastinate writing his thesis. Unfortunately, he became a regular performer at the Ann Arbor Comedy Showcase. He recently moved to Silver Spring, MD, where he has performed on showcases alongside Robert Mac, Paris Sashay and many other local favorites. As an immigrant his act is comprised of puns, paraprodoskians, non sequitirs and other words he can neither spell nor pronounce. He recently won the DC Improv PUN DMV (Freestlye) in January 2019. He will be at Gilda's LaughFest, Grand Rapids, MI in March 2019 and at Paul Bunyan Comedy Festival, Oscoda, MI in April 2019.
